# Entries

Entries are the primary container for content you want to display on your web pages. Each entry has _Title_, _Author_, a _Post Date_, an _Expiration Date_ (if desired), a _Status_ (enabled or disabled), and—like other [element types](elements.md)—flexible content defined via [custom fields](fields.md). Also like other elements, entries can have their own [URLs](#entry-uri-formats), or be fetched from anywhere via [element queries](#querying-entries).

Content authors also get access to a powerful [drafts and revisions](#editing-entries) system, allowing them to stage different versions of content and preview it alongside the current live entry.

Entries are one of Craft’s built-in [element types](elements.md), and are represented throughout the application as instances of <craft4:craft\elements\Entry>.

## Sections

Before you can create entries, you must create Sections to contain them. In each Section you can define the following:

- Whether entries in the section have URLs;
- What the entries’ URLs should look like;
- Which template should get loaded if an entry’s URL is requested;
- What types of entries should be available in the section, and which fields each of those [entry types](#entry-types) should have;

If your project has multiple [sites](sites.md), your Section can define these additional settings:

- Which sites entries in the section should target;
- Which sites are enabled by default when creating new entries;

To create a new section, go to **Settings** → **Sections** and choose **New Section**.

### Section Types

Craft has three different types of sections:

#### Singles

![Illustration of Entries layout with “Singles” selected, showing “About Us”, “Contact” and “Home” entries](./images/entry-types-singles.png)

Singles are used for one-off pages or content objects that have unique requirements, such as…

- …a website’s homepage;
- …an _About Us_ page;
- …a _Contact Us_ page;

Unlike the other section types, singles only ever have _one_ entry associated with them, meaning their URIs can be static (like `contact-us`) rather than parameterized (like `news/{slug}`).

Like [globals](./globals.md), singles don’t have an editable **Author**, **Post Date**, or **Expiration Date**.

::: tip
Singles have all the functionality of [globals](./globals.md), and can even be pre-loaded into global Twig variables with the <config4:preloadSingles> <Since ver="4.4.0" feature="Preloading singles entries" /> config setting.

A single’s **Status** controls can be hidden with the **Show the Status field** setting in its sole **Entry Type**. <Since ver="4.5.0" feature="Hiding status fields for singles" />
:::

#### Channels

![Illustration of Entries layout with a “Press Releases” channel selected, showing three dated news entries](./images/entry-types-channels.png)

Channels are used for lists or streams of similar content, such as…

- …posts on a blog;
- …articles in a knowledge base;
- …recipes;
- …reviews;

Entries in channels are intended to be queried and displayed ordered by one or more of their attributes or [custom fields](./fields.md)—or explicitly attached to other elements via [entries fields](./entries-fields.md). Channels are also a simple way to maintain a flat taxonomy, standing in for [tags](./tags.md) or [categories](./categories.md).

#### Structures

Structures are an extension of channels that support explicit, hierarchical ordering.

![Illustration of Entries layout with a “Galleries” structure selected, showing nested building and gallery entries with drag-and-drop handles](./images/entry-types-structures.png)

Unlike other section types, structure sections expose a **Structure** view option on their [element indexes](./elements.md#indexes):

![Illustration of an element index’s “View” options with “Structure” selected.](./images/entry-types-structure-view-mode.png)

Types of content that might benefit from being defined as a structure include…

- …documentation;
- …a “Services” section, where the order of services matters;
- …a company organization chart with personnel and teams;
- …editable navigation menus;

Just like channels, entries in structures can be assigned [types](#entry-types). Structures offer great flexibility in presentation—in particular, the ability to collect nested content on a parent page, or alter the appearance of pages based on their hierarchical “depth” within a bundle of content.

::: tip
Structures can also make use of the **Maintain Hierarchy** <Since ver="4.4.0" feature="Maintain Hierarchy setting on entries fields" /> setting on entries fields.
:::

#### Custom Sources

Content authors can add their own special element sources based on existing Singles, Channels, and Structures by creating custom sources. Each custom source lists all entries by default, and can be filtered to only those that meet customized **Entry Criteria**.

To create a new custom source, go to **Entries** → **Customize (<icon kind="settings" />)**, and from the bottom-left “+” menu choose **New custom source**:

![Screenshot of a modal window with fields for a new custom source: Label, Entry Criteria, and Table Columns](./images/custom-source.png)

### Entry URI Formats

<Todo text="Another bunch of object template stuff that needs consolidation..." />

Channel and structure sections can choose whether their entries should be assigned URLs in the system by filling in the **Entry URI Format** setting. Singles have a “URI” setting, but it is typically defined statically or omitted (if it doesn’t need its own URL).

When Craft matches a request to an entry, its section’s designated **Template** is rendered. That template is automatically provided an `entry` variable, set to the resolved <craft4:craft\elements\Entry> object, and ready to output any of its attributes or custom field data.

Entry URI Formats are tiny Twig templates, which get evaluated each time an entry in the section is saved. The result is saved as the entry’s **URI** in the system, and is used to generate URLs (i.e. via `entry.url`) and when Craft is determining how to [route](routing.md) a request.

The entry being saved is available to that _object template_—just like its main template—so something like this is possible:

```twig
blog/authors/{{ object.author.username }}/{{ object.slug }}
```

A shortcut syntax is also available if you are accessing simple properties on the `object` variable:

```twig
blog/authors/{author.username}/{slug}
```

::: tip
There are some more tips for using object templates in the [title formatting](#dynamic-entry-titles) section.
:::

#### Hierarchical URIs

Structure sections may benefit from nested paths, for child entries:

```twig
{parent.uri}/{slug}
```

Suppose our structure represents geographic regions on Earth. With the above **Entry URI Format**, a top-level “continent” entry URI might be `south-america`; a nested “country” entry’s URI would then be `south-america/chile`.

Structure sections might also want to include a segment before the nested path:

```twig
{parent.uri ?? 'earth'}/{slug}
```

The above template could also be expressed with this syntax:

```twig
{% if level == 1 %}earth{% else %}{parent.uri}{% endif %}/{slug}
```

With the above Entry URI Format, a top-level entry’s URI would be `earth/south-america`, with a nested entry having `earth/south-america/chile`.

::: tip
Consider these tips for creating special URIs:
- A URI that evaluates to `__home__` (and nothing more) will be available at your site’s base path;
- An empty URI means the entry does not get a route and will not have a public URL—unless you define one manually via `routes.php`;
- Any Twig statement can be used to output values in a URI template—including ones that query for other elements,  e.g. `{{ craft.entries().section('mySingle').one().slug }}/news`;
- [Aliases](./config/README.md#aliases-and-environment-variables) can be evaluated with the [`alias()` function](./dev/functions.md#alias): `{{ alias('@basePressUri') }}/news`, `{{ alias('@mySectionUri') }}`.
- The [null-coalescing operator](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/templates.html#other-operators) (`??`) can silently swallow undefined variable errors (like `parent.uri`, above);
:::

### Preview Targets

If you’re using Craft Pro, your section can have one or more **Preview Targets**, or URLs where your entries will show up on. This makes it possible for authors to preview entries as they are writing them in the control panel, or share a private URL with colleagues to view changes prior to publishing.

Like entry URI formats, these preview target URLs are simple Twig templates that can contain entry properties and other dynamic values.

Use single curly braces to render attributes on the entry. For example if entries in your section have their own URLs, then you can create a preview target for the entry’s primary URL using the URL template, `{url}`.

Create additional preview targets for any other areas the entry might show up, such as `news`, or `archive/{postDate|date('Y')}`. If the entries show up on the homepage, you can create a preview target with a blank URL (unlike URI formats, a blank URL _is_ valid, here).

![A section’s Preview Targets setting.](./images/preview-targets.png)

Preview target **URL Formats** support slightly different features than for **URI Formats**:

- If you want to include the entry’s ID or UID in a preview target URL, use `{canonicalId}` or `{canonicalUid}` rather than `{id}` or `{uid}`, so the source entry’s ID or UID is used rather than the [draft](#drafts)’s;
- You can use [environment variables and aliases](./config/README.md#control-panel-settings) in the preview target URL. These _do not_ get wrapped in curly braces on their own, as they are not part of the object template. Aliases may be part of a longer URI (e.g.`@headlessUrl/news/{slug}`), but environment variables can only be used on their own (e.g. `$NEWS_INDEX`);

When an author is editing an entry from a section with custom preview targets, the **View** button will be replaced with a menu that lists the **Primary entry page** (if the section has an Entry URI Format), plus the names of each preview target.

![An entry’s View menu with 3 custom preview targets.](./images/share-with-targets.png =394x)

If you share a link from this menu that includes a preview token, it will expire by default after one day. You can customize this with the [defaultTokenDuration](config4:defaultTokenDuration) config setting.

The targets will also be available within **Preview**.

#### Previewing Decoupled Front Ends

If your site’s front end lives outside of Craft (e.g. as a Vue or React app), you can still support previewing drafts and revisions with **Preview** or **Share** buttons. To do that, your front end must check for the existence of a `token` query string parameter (or whatever the <config4:tokenParam> setting is). If it’s in the URL, then you will need to pass that same token in the request that loads the page content. This token will cause the API request to respond with the correct content based on what the token was created to preview.

<Block label="Nuxt Example">

Whether you are using the Element API plugin or the built-in [GraphQL](graphql.md) API, Craft automatically injects preview elements whenever they match the query being executed.

To illustrate, suppose you were building a [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) application, and you used the [file-based routing scheme](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/routing) to render blog posts: you would create `pages/blog/[slug].vue`, then define a preview target in Craft with a similar path, like `@nuxt/blog/{slug}`.

```vue
<script setup>
const route = useRoute();

// Construct a GraphQL fragment using the route param:
const query = `{
  entry(slug: "${route.params.slug}") {
    title
    description
  }
}`;

// Fetch the incoming token:
const token = route.query.token;

// Build the URL, with `query` and `token` params:
const { data: gql } = await useFetch('https://my-project.ddev.site/api', {
  params: { query, token },
});
</script>

<template>
  <article>
    <h1>{{ gql.data.entry.title }}</h1>
    <code>{{ gql.data.entry.uid }}</code>
  </article>
</template>
```

This assumes you have defined a [GraphQL API route](graphql.md#setting-up-your-api-endpoint) of `api`, and that the previewed entry will reliably have (at least) a slug set. When the `token` param is omitted, Nuxt ignores it and the GraphQL API will respond as though it were any other request for an entry with the given slug.

</Block>

You can pass the token via either a query string parameter named after your <config4:tokenParam> config setting, or an `X-Craft-Token` header.

::: tip
For live preview, you should also consider [enabling iFrame Resizer](config4:useIframeResizer) so that Craft can maintain the page scroll position between page loads.
:::

## Entry Types

Both Channel and Structure sections let you define multiple “types” of entries using _entry types_. Singles only have one entry type

You can manage your sections’ entry types by choosing **Edit Entry Types** link beside the section’s name in **Settings** → **Sections**. That’ll take you to the section’s entry type index. Choosing on an entry type’s name takes you to its settings page:

<BrowserShot
  url="https://my-craft-project.ddev.site/admin/settings/sections/1/entry-types/1"
  :link="false"
  caption="Editing an entry type in the control panel.">
  <img src="./images/sections-and-entries-entry-types.png" alt="Screenshot of entry type settings">
</BrowserShot>

Entry types have the following settings:

- **Name** — The entry type’s name;
- **Handle** — The entry type’s template-facing handle;
- **Show the Title field?** — Whether a Title field is displayed for entries of this type, or the title should be [dynamically defined](#dynamic-entry-titles) from other properties via an object template;
- **Title Translation Method** — Control how titles are [translated](#translation-settings) across sites and site groups.
- **Slug Translation Method** — Control how slugs are [translated](#translation-settings) across sites and site groups.
- **Title Field Label** — What the Title field label should be;

### Dynamic Entry Titles

If you want your entries’s titles to be auto-generated from a template (rather than requiring authors to enter them manually), you can uncheck the **Show the Title field?** checkbox. When you do, a new **Title Format** setting will appear.

The **Title Format** is a [Twig](./dev/twig-primer.md) template (just like the **Entry URI Format** and preview target **URL Format** we looked, above), and gets evaluated whenever entries with this type are saved.

The entry is passed to this template as a variable named `object`. You can reference the entry’s [properties](craft4:craft\elements\Entry#public-properties) and custom fields in two ways:

1. normal Twig syntax: `{{ object.property }}`
2. shortcut Twig syntax: `{property}`

<Todo text="Object templates need to be consolidated." />

If Craft finds any of these in your **Title Format**, it will replace the `{` with `{{object.` and the `}` with `}}`, before passing the template off to Twig for parsing.

You can use Twig filters in both syntaxes:

```twig
{# Long: #}
Coupons (Valid through {{ object.expiryDate|date('M j, Y') }})

{# Short: #}
Coupons (Valid through {expiryDate|date('M j, Y')})
```

Craft’s [global variables](dev/global-variables.md) are available to these templates as well:

```twig
Current Coupons (Last updated {{ now|date('Y-m-d') }})
Current Coupons (Last updated by {{ currentUser.username }})
```

Logic is also supported, but there’s no syntactic sugar for control tags—any conditions in an object template require that you reference properties explicitly, with the `object` variable:

```twig
{# Control tags: #}
{% if object.expiryDate %}{expiryDate|date('M j, Y')}{% else %}{{ now|date('M j, Y') }}{% endif %}

{# Ternary operator: #}
{{ (object.expiryDate ?: now)|date('M j, Y') }}
```

### Translation Settings

Most localization behavior is determined by [section](#sections) and [field](fields.md) settings, but the translation of titles and slugs is governed by entry types.

The available translation methods are covered in the [custom fields documentation](fields.md#translation-methods).

## Editing Entries

If you have at least one section, there will be an **Entries** menu item in the primary control panel navigation. Clicking on it will take you to the entry [index](elements.md#indexes). From there, you can navigate to the entry you wish to edit, or create a new one.

Depending on your section’s settings, can perform some or all of the following actions from any entry’s edit screen:

- Choose the entry type (if there is more than one to choose from);
- Edit the entry’s **Title**, **Slug**, and [custom field](fields.md) values;
- Choose the entry’s **Author** (Pro edition only);
- Choose the entry’s **Parent** (if it’s within a [Structure](#structures) section);
- Set the entry’s **Post Date** (when it will be considered published);
- Set the entry’s **Expiration Date** (optional);
- Choose whether the entry is **Enabled** or not (globally, and/or per-site);
- Save changes to the entry;
- Save a new [draft](#drafts) of the entry;
- View [revisions](#revisions) of the entry;
- Apply changes from a derivative (draft or revision);

::: tip
If you leave the **Post Date** blank, Craft will automatically set it the first time an entry is saved as enabled.
:::

### Entry Creation

As soon as you click **New entry**, Craft creates an empty entry, and redirects you to its edit screen. This gives the system a place to auto-save your edits—effectively a new entry represented only as a [draft](#drafts). Internally, this is called a “fresh” entry.

Once you add some content to a fresh entry (or explicitly choose **Save draft** from the **Create entry** menu), Craft marks the draft as having been saved, and will expose it in element indexes when using the **All** or **Draft** status options.

::: tip
Stray drafts (those that were created but never edited or explicitly saved) are automatically [garbage-collected](gc.md), respecting the <config4:purgeUnsavedDraftsDuration> setting.
:::

The entry editing lifecycle is designed to provide authors clear, actionable information about the state of their content, and to prevent unintended loss. Let’s look more closely at a few supporting features.

### Drafts

As soon as you alter a field on an entry, Craft auto-saves the changes as a _provisional draft_.

![Screenshot of an entry with unsaved changes](./images/entries-edit-provisional.png)

Subsequent edits are also saved to your provisional draft, and made available any time you view that entry in the control panel. Each user gets their own provisional draft, so your changes are private.

Pressing the **Save** button applies changes from a provisional draft to its _canonical_ entry, and creates a _revision_ (if its section supports revisions).

If you aren’t ready to publish your changes, you can instead press **Create a Draft** to save your work as a new _draft_. You may have as many regular drafts as you wish—and those drafts can have their own name and notes to help you track what you’re working on. The name of your current draft (if any) is shown at the top of the edit screen in the [revision](#revisions) menu.

::: warning
Your drafts may be visible to (and editable by) other users! While an auto-saved _provisional_ draft is always private, the visibility of _saved_ drafts is governed by users’ [permissions for the entry’s section](user-management.md#permissions).
:::

While Craft’s auto-saving behavior creates a provisional draft from the canonical entry, edits to an existing, explicitly-saved draft are saved directly to that draft—in other words, Craft doesn’t create drafts for another draft!

When your edits are ready to be published, press **Apply draft** to merge the changes into the canonical entry.

### Revisions

Any time you apply a draft (provisional or otherwise) to the canonical entry, Craft creates a _revision_. Revisions track which fields and attributes changed each time the canonical entry is updated, and provide a means to revert to previous versions of an entry. Drafts and revisions both have a `creator` property that stores what user initiated the update separately from the “author.”

::: tip
The revision menu only displays the ten most recent revisions. Older revisions are available via the **View all revisions &rarr;** link at the bottom of the menu.

Any time a revision is created, Craft pushes a job into the [queue](queue.md) to ensure the oldest one(s) are pruned (if there are more revisions than allowed by the <config4:maxRevisions> setting).
:::

#### Querying for Revisions

You can [find](#querying-entries) drafts and revisions of a specific entry using the [draftOf()](#draftof) and [revisionOf()](#revisionof) query params.

### Trash

All [elements](elements.md) support _soft-deletion_. When you delete an entry, its `dateDeleted` property is set to the current time, and Craft excludes it from results—unless the [`trashed` query param](#trashed) is used. Similarly, when restoring a deleted entry, its `dateDeleted` is set to `null`.

::: warning
Entries remain in the “trashed” state until they are manually hard-deleted from the control panel or their `dateDeleted` is longer ago than the <config4:softDeleteDuration> setting when [garbage collection](gc.md) runs.

**The trash should not be used to temporarily remove content from your site.** Restoring trashed entries is only intended as a means to recover inadvertently-deleted content—instead, use the global or site-specific **Enabled** settings. Entries can remain disabled indefinitely.
:::

### Activity <Since ver="4.5.0" feature="Element editing activity indicators" />

Craft keeps track of user activity on entries, and will push presence pips and notifications to anyone working with drafts of the same entry.

<BrowserShot
  url="https://my-craft-project.ddev.site/admin/entries/blog/247"
  :link="false"
  caption="Other users editing the same entry will appear in the page header. TJ has corrected the page title in a draft.">
<img src="./images/entries-edit-activity.png" alt="Screenshot of the entry edit screen with other active users">
</BrowserShot>

Notifications will appear in the bottom-left corner along with other flashes, and prompt you to reload the entry if it has changed since you opened it. This can play out in a couple ways:

- If another user applied a draft to the canonical entry while you were working on a provisional draft, Craft will merge all non-conflicting edits into your provisional draft. In situations where you both made changes to a field, Craft keeps your changes.
- If only the other user made a change, the page simply refreshes to show the new canonical entry content.

::: tip
Automatic merging of changes from canonical entries is nondestructive, and non-optional. Merging occurs just before an entry’s edit screen is viewed.
:::

## Querying Entries

While an entry’s configured template will automatically make an `entry` variable available, you can fetch entries throughout your templates or PHP code using **entry queries**.

::: code
```twig
{# Create a new entry query #}
{% set myEntryQuery = craft.entries() %}
```
```php
// Create a new entry query
$myEntryQuery = \craft\elements\Entry::find();
```
:::

Once you’ve created an entry query, you can set [parameters](#parameters) on it to narrow down the results, and then [execute it](element-queries.md#executing-element-queries) by calling `.all()`. An array of [Entry](craft4:craft\elements\Entry) objects will be returned.

::: tip
See [Element Queries](element-queries.md) to learn about how element queries work.
:::

### Example

We can display the 10 most recent entries in a “Blog” section by doing the following:

1. Create an entry query with `craft.entries()`.
2. Set the [section](#section) and [limit](#limit) parameters on it.
3. Fetch the entries with `.all()`.
4. Loop through the entries using a [for](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/tags/for.html) tag to output the blog post HTML.

```twig
{# Create an entry query with the 'section' and 'limit' parameters #}
{% set myEntryQuery = craft.entries()
  .section('blog')
  .limit(10) %}

{# Fetch the entries #}
{% set entries = myEntryQuery.all() %}

{# Display the entries #}
{% for entry in entries %}
  <article>
    <h1><a href="{{ entry.url }}">{{ entry.title }}</a></h1>
    {{ entry.summary }}
    <a href="{{ entry.url }}">Continue reading</a>
  </article>
{% endfor %}
```

#### `preferSites`

If [unique](#unique) is set, this determines which site should be selected when querying multi-site elements.



For example, if element “Foo” exists in Site A and Site B, and element “Bar” exists in Site B and Site C,

for Site C.

If this isn’t set, then preference goes to the current site.

{% set entries = craft.entries()
  .site('*')
  .unique()
  .preferSites(['a', 'b'])
  .all() %}
```

```php
// Fetch unique entries from Site A, or Site B if they don’t exist in Site A
